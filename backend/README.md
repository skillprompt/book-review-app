# **Book Review App - Backend: High-Level Documentation**

This document provides a **high-level overview** of the backend system for the **Book Review App**. The backend is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, providing a RESTful API for user authentication, book management, and review submission. Below, we cover the **architecture**, **core features**, **database design**, and **API structure**.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for building RESTful APIs
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user, book, and review data
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions
- **Authorization**: Role-based (admin users manage books, regular users can submit reviews)
- **Security**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt, JWTs for stateless authentication
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
- **Validation**: Zod for validating user input

---

## **Core Features**

### **User Authentication & Authorization**

- **Registration**: Users can create accounts with a username, email, and password.
- **Login & JWT Tokens**: Users receive a **JWT** on login, which allows access to protected routes.
- **User Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Can add, update, and delete books.
  - **User**: Can submit and update reviews.
- **Session Management**: Logout by invalidating JWTs on the client-side.

### **Book Management**

- **Book Listing**: Retrieve all available books.
- **Book Details**: Access detailed information about individual books, including user reviews.
- **Book Creation**: Admins can add new books to the collection.
- **Book Update**: Admins can modify book details.
- **Book Deletion**: Admins can remove books from the system.

### **Review Management**

- **Review Submission**: Users can post reviews with ratings and text.
- **Review Update**: Authors of reviews can edit their own submissions.
- **Review Deletion**: Reviews can be deleted by their authors or by admins.

## **Security Considerations**

1. **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before being stored in the database.
2. **JWT Authentication**: Tokens are generated on login and verified for access to protected routes.
3. **Role-Based Authorization**: Admin-only routes for managing books, while users can manage their reviews.
4. **Input Validation**: Prevents malicious input by validating request bodies using **Zod**.
5. **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware to catch and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## **Error Codes & Responses**

| **HTTP Status**  | **Description**                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
